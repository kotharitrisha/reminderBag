The key insight is that interaction breakdowns in creation-oriented applications often manifest themselves in backtracking operations that can be automatically logged (e.g., undo and erase operations).

Based on 5,611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a corpus of dissertation abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction.

Traditionally, people with CVD have been supported by recolouring tools that improve colour differentiability, but do not consider the subjective properties of colour schemes while recolouring. To address this, we developed SPRWeb, a tool that recolours websites to preserve subjective responses and improve colour differentiability - thus enabling users with CVD to have similar online experiences. To develop SPRWeb, we extended existing models of non-CVD subjective responses to CVD, then used this extended model to steer the recolouring process. In a lab study, we found that SPRWeb did significantly better than a standard recolouring tool at preserving the temperature and naturalness of websites, while achieving similar weight and differentiability preservation.

We find that super agent efficiency stems from two simple optimizations --- they are 3x more likely than other agents to chain tasks and they pick fewer lower priced tasks than other agents. We compare mobile and online micro-task markets, and discuss differences in demographics, data quality, and time of use, as well as similarities in super agent behavior.

In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61% of their friends each month.

On the other, good UX design requires holistic thinking about the entire system and UX groups are challenged to maintain this focus even during the continual heads-down work of sprints. \\  \\ This course seeks to give UX designers specific, actionable techniques to handle this new situation. We briefly review why UX techniques are critical to delivering on the promise of Agile development\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhow UX techniques permit the initial project backlog to be developed effectively and ensure that project iterations evolve the product in a direction useful to its users. \\ The bulk of the course discusses the five key skills described above\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat the UX designer should be doing, why that works in the context of an Agile project, and how the UX designer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing skills are critical to supporting Agile development. The discussion of each skill is supported with examples from Agile teams.  \\  \\ One critical skill\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwriting user stories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis practiced in the session. This is a core skill and requires that UX designers think about their design in a different way and break it up in counter-intuitive ways they may not be familiar with, so focused practice is useful.  \\ This course is informed by our years of experience working with Agile teams, so we can not only describe how UX designers should integrate with Agile teams in theory, but how things actually work in practice.  \\  \\ Content \\   \\ The course contains the following main parts: \\ First, we briefly summarize the origins of Agile development to provide shared context for all participants. We describe the problems developers faced and how these methods gave them control over some of their most intractable problems. We are honest about the shortcomings of the methods as well\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbeing designed by developers, for developers, they are limited in the scope of the problems they attempt to address (the world begins and ends with coding) and in the techniques they use (none of the standard methods for involving users are part of the Agile toolbox). This section is short\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe course is not intended as a general introduction to Agile. \\  \\ We then describe six industry best practices for incorporating UX work into an Agile team. These techniques are tried and tested, so new Agile teams can depend on them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pioneer them. We discuss: \\  \\ 1. Bring a user focus to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Phase 0\u00e2\u20ac\u009d activities to help define the right user stories. \\  \\ Why a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Phase 0\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sprint 0\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is needed to drive Agile development; how it is used to drive user story creation; making Phase 0 user-centered and Agile; validating concepts captured in user stories; how much is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just enough\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to drive Agile development. \\  \\ 2. Write and prioritize user stories to deliver the most important user value while accommodating development needs. \\  \\ What a user story looks like; why they are valuable to development; how to split up larger stories into smaller ones; why stories should not be split along component lines but instead should deliver user value; how to balance competing goals when prioritizing stories into sprints.  \\ We practice writing user stories so participants can work with the different ways to structure a user story that delivers coherent user value while still being small enough for Agile development. \\  \\ 3. Work out low-level design details with users within the constrained timeframe of a sprint. \\  \\ The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no BDUF\u00e2\u20ac\u009d value means low-level details will be worked out during sprints; when and why to design one sprint ahead and test one sprint behind; alternative methods of interleaving design and development work; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four users every Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as a method to bring user data into the process; how to use low-fidelity prototyping to work out design details.  \\  \\ 4. Gather real user feedback on the code as developed in each sprint and work that feedback into the Agile process. \\  \\ How to use user visits to test running code; how to run such user tests; how to design and communicate changes to the development team; alternative methods of working design changes into the backlog; how to maintain overall UI design coherence despite the focused, rapid nature of Agile development. \\  \\ 5. Maintain a coherent picture of the UI across user stories and sprints. \\ User stories and short sprints make it difficult to maintain a whole-system view of the product being created; how to maintain that view across sprints and across multiple teams working on the same system. \\  \\ 6. Be a full member of the development team with real collaboration with developers throughout the development process. \\  \\ What it means to be a full team member; where to sit, when to show up, when to have face-to-face discussions; how (and why) to involve developers in aspects of UI design; how to fit collaboration with developers into the tasks of a sprint; how and why to track UI tasks in the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tracking tools. \\  \\ Assumed Background of Attendees: \\  \\ This course is appropriate for all backgrounds. It is designed especially for UX designers and managers who are currently working with Agile teams and wish to improve their cooperation with those teams, or who expect to be in that situation soon. \\  \\ Presentation Format: \\  \\ The course will consist of lecture and an exercise done in pairs, followed by discussion.   \\  \\ Schedule \\  \\ Minutes Topic  \\ 5\tOverview of Agile development \\ 40 \tTechniques for UX involvement on an Agile team \\ 20\tExercise: Writing user stories \\ 15 \tSummary: The structure of an Agile project \\  \\ Audience Size: \\  \\ There is no limit to the number of people who can be in this course.

The entertainment industry is increasingly providing visual and body-based cues to their users to increase the naturalness of their navigational experience. \\ However, so far none of the existing solutions fully supports the most natural ways of locomotion through virtual worlds, and thus techniques and technologies have to be considered, which take advantage of insights into human perceptual sensitivity. In this context, by far the most natural way to move through the real world is via a full body experience where we receive sensory stimulation to all of our senses, i.e., when walking, running, biking or driving. With some exciting technological advances, people are now beginning to get this same full body sensory experience when navigating computer generated three-dimensional environments. Enabling such an active and dynamic ability to navigate through large-scale virtual scenes is of great interest for many interactive 3D applications demanding locomotion, such as video games, edutainment, simulation, rehabilitation, military, tourism or architecture. \\  \\ In this course we will present an overview about the development of interactive locomotion interfaces for computer generated virtual environments ranging from desktop-based camera manipulations simulating walking, and different walking metaphors for the entertainment to state-of-the-art hardware-based solutions that enable omni-directional and unlimited real locomotion through virtual worlds.

While most computers become obsolete in less than a decade, this 30-year-old computer technology remains useful because it provides exciting, multi-user family entertainment. While having minimal processing power and virtually no connectivity, the 8-bit computer supports input and output channels that are especially suited for co-located social game play.

Therefore, we offer low-cost design recommendations that would enable outdated PCs to support greater shared use and increased utility within the constrained material context of low-income households.

Results of the study show that participants perform significantly better on all four tasks while using the NoteVideo and its improved version - NoteVideo+ - as compared to others.", "title": "NoteVideo: Facilitating Navigation of Blackboard-style Lecture Videos", "award": 0}, "pn1172": {"c_and_b": "We conducted 44 interviews with people from America, Asia, Europe and Africa, and found a large variation in their motivation and strategies for achieving anonymity on the Internet.", "hm": 0, "session": "s275", "communities": [], "authors": [{"familyName": "Kang", "middleInitial": null, "primary": {"dept": "Human Computer Interaction Institute", "state": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "institution": "Carnegie Mellon University", "city": "Pittsburgh"}, "rank": 0, "email": "ruoguk@cs.cmu.edu", "role": "presenter", "givenName": "Ruogu", "id": "auth12637", "secondary": null}, {"familyName": "Brown", "middleInitial": null, "primary": {"dept": "Department of Psychology", "state": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "institution": "Carnegie Mellon University", "city": "Pittsburgh"}, "rank": 1, "email": "smb1@andrew.cmu.edu", "role": "", "givenName": "Stephanie", "id": "auth29534", "secondary": null}, {"familyName": "Kiesler", "middleInitial": null, "primary": {"dept": "Human Computer Interaction Institute", "state": "Pennsylvania", "country": "United States", "institution": "Carnegie Mellon University", "city": "Pittsburgh"}, "rank": 2, "email": "kiesler@cs.cmu.edu", "role": "backupPresenter", "givenName": "Sara", "id": "auth1474", "secondary": null}], "keywords": "Anonymity; online community; information disclosure; privacy", "subtype": "Paper", "abstract": "In this research we set out to discover why and how people seek anonymity in their online interactions.

The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how these could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.", "title": "Speech-based Interaction: Myths, Challenges, and Opportunities", "award": 0}, "crs160": {"c_and_b": "null", "hm": 0, "session": "s136", "communities": ["ux"], "authors": [{"familyName": "Farnham", "middleInitial": null, "primary": {"city": "Redmond", "state": "Washington", "institution": "FUSE Labs", "country": "United States"}, "rank": 0, "email": "shellyfa@microsoft.com", "role": "", "givenName": "Shelly", "id": "auth1985", "secondary": null}, {"familyName": "Kiciman", "middleInitial": null, "primary": {"city": "Redmond", "state": "WA", "institution": "Microsoft Research", "country": "USA"}, "rank": 1, "email": "emrek@microsoft.com", "role": "", "givenName": "Emre", "id": "auth23109", "secondary": null}], "keywords": "null", "subtype": "", "abstract": "", "title": "Analyzing Social Media Data", "award": 0}, "pn1025": {"c_and_b": "We designed interactive systems to investigate how digital materials might be passed down.

It has emphasized specific constructs (e.g., affect, needs, hedonics) and their interrelation, but rarely analyzed the content of the narratives. We analyze the content and structure of 691 user-generated narratives on positive and negative experiences with technology. We use a multi-method approach consisting of manual (structural analysis of narratives) as well as of automated content analysis methods (psycholinguistic analysis and machine learning). These analyses show converging evidence that positive narratives predominantly concern social aspects such as family and friends. In addition, technology is positively experienced when it enables users to do things more efficiently or in a new way.

Spatial consistency allows users to develop memory of object locations, reducing the time needed for visual search, and because spatial memory is long lasting and has a large capacity these performance benefits are enduring and scalable. This suggests that spatial consistency could be used as a fundamental principle for the design of interfaces. However, there are many display situations where the standard presentation is altered in some way: e.g., a window is moved to a new location, scaled, or rotated on a mobile or tabletop display. It is not known whether the benefits of spatial organization are robust to these common kinds of view transformation. To assess these effects, we tested user performance with a spatial interface that had been transformed in several ways, including different degrees of translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective change. We found that performance was not strongly affected by the changes, except in the case of large rotations. To demonstrate the value of spatial consistency over existing mechanisms for dealing with view changes, we compared user performance with a spatially-stable presentation (using scaling) with that of a 'reflowing' presentation (widely used in current interfaces). This study showed that spatial stability with scaling dramatically outperforms reflowing.

Research has investigated how interface designs can help prevent users from making number entry errors. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of two possible interface designs aimed at helping users detect number entry errors using the idea of a checksum: an additional (redundant) number that is related to the to-be-entered numbers in such a way that it is sufficient to verify the correctness of the checksum, as opposed to checking each of the entered numbers. The first interface requires users to check their own work with the help of the checksum; the second requires the user to enter the checksum along with the other numbers so that the system can do the checking. In each case, two numbers needed to be entered, while the third number served as a checksum. With the first interface, users caught only 36% of their errors. The second interface resulted in all errors being caught, but the need to enter the checksum increased entry time by 46%. When participants were allowed to choose between the two interfaces, they chose the second interface in only 12% of the cases. Although these results cannot be generalized to other specific contexts, the results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each way of using checksums to catch number entry errors.

Promising means to provide basic communication abilities to subjects affected by severe motor impairments are brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), i.e., systems that directly translate brain signals into device commands bypassing any muscle or nerve mediation. To date, the use of BCIs for effective verbal communication is yet an open issue - primarily due to the low rates of information transfer that can be achieved with this technology. Still, the performance of BCI spelling applications can be considerably improved by a smart user interface design and by the adoption of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text prediction.  The objective of this work is to suggest an approach and a user interface for BCI spelling applications combining state-of-the-art BCI and NLP techniques to maximize the overall communication rate of the system. The BCI paradigm adopted is motor imagery, i.e., when the subject imagines to move a certain part of the body, he/she produces modifications to specific brain rhythms that are detected in real-time through an electroencephalogram and translated into commands for a spelling application. By maximizing the overall communication rate our approach is twofold: on one hand we maximize the information transfer rate from the control signal, on the other side we optimize the way this information is employed for the purpose of verbal communication. The achieved results are satisfactory and comparable with the latest works reported in literature on motor-imagery BCI spellers.

The packaging of software in multiple applications, each with its own pre-determined set of compartmentalized functions, forced users into the role of software integrators. \\  \\ In 2008 the Mission Control Technologies (MCT) project sought to address these issues by replacing multiple NASA Mission Control applications with composable user-objects. The primary stakeholders were NASA flight controllers and mission operations management. \\  \\ The feature that sold mission management on the project was that user objects modeled their real world counterparts. Once a user object was created, say for Space Station telemetry, that object could be reused. This meant that the association between a user object and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data needed to happen once, as opposed to previous software systems, which required data to be associated with on screen displays each time a new display was built.  \\  \\ While we sought to design and develop a new system, it was important to realize that the existing software was working, that users were familiar with that software from years of use, and the introduction of change was potentially disruptive to users.   \\  \\ At the request of our customer, the initial MCT user objects would be for telemetry and monitoring of the Space Station. To design the software, we used participatory design (PD), in which the users are the domain experts and the designers facilitate the sessions.

We envision that such networks are not restricted to display owners and advertisers anymore, but allow also passersby (e.g., customers) to exchange content, similar to traditional public notice areas, such as bulletin boards. In this context it is crucial to understand emerging practices and provide easy and straight forward interaction techniques to be used for creating and exchanging content. In this paper, we present Digifieds, a digital public notice area we built to investigate and compare possible interaction techniques. Based on a lab study we show that using direct touch at the display as well as using the mobile phone as a complementing interaction technology are most suitable. Direct touch at the display closely resembles the interaction known from classic bulletin boards and provides the highest usability. Mobile phones preserve the users' privacy as they exchange (sensitive) data with the display and at the same time allow content to be created on-the-go or to be retrieved.
