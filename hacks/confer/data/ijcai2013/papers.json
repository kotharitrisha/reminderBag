Mini-Bucket\n\nElimination (MBE) is a well-known approximation algorithm for graphical\n\nmodels. It relies on a procedure to partition a set of functions into\n\nsmaller subsets. In most previous works, the partitioning process\n\nconsiders the scopes of the functions only. Very recently, a new class\n\nof partitioning schemes based on the content of the functions was\n\nproposed for the task of computing the probability of the evidence. In\n\nthis paper we introduce a general partitioning framework for defining content-based partitioning-heuristics for a variety of problems. The framework is\n\nbased on two elements: a semiring structure endowed with an additional\n\noperation called division, and a valid metric. We then\n\nshow how this framework is instantiated to define content-based\n\nheuristics for optimization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate their impact on\n\na number of benchmarks for the task of computing the Most Probable\n\nExplanation. In particular, we show that the recent Moment-Matching technique for MBE benefits from using content-based heuristics.", "authors": [{"name": "Emma Rollon"}, {"name": " Rina Dechter"}], "title": "Semiring-Based Mini-Bucket Partition Heuristics"}, "1402": {"abstract": "Security is a critical concern around the world, which arises in protecting people and critical assets from the threat of terrorist attacks and criminal behaviours.

It does not know the distribution of problems, the space of solutions is not smooth, and the reward signal is uninformative, providing perhaps a few bits of information but not enough to steer it effectively. How can such a learner ever get off the ground? A common intuition is that if the solutions to these problems share a common structure, and the learner can solve some simple problems by brute force, it should be able to extract useful components from these solutions and, by composing them, explore the solution space more efficiently. Here, we formalize this intuition, where the solution space is the space of typed functional programs and the gained information is stored as a stochastic grammar over programs. We propose an iterative procedure for exploring such spaces: in the first step of each iteration, the learner explores a finite subset of the domain, guided by a stochastic grammar; in the second step, the learner compresses the successful solutions from the first step to estimate a new stochastic grammar. We test this procedure on symbolic regression and boolean circuit learning and show that the learner discovers modular concepts for these domains.

Thus, compared with traditional detection measures, our approach tends to be robust to noise features, and thus the aHSIC is suited for a high-dimensional time-series data.

A scheduling problem arises if we have a set of temporal events whose starting times are subject to temporal constraints, and we have to set these starting times in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In many cases, disturbances are bound to occur during schedule execution. It such situations, it makes more sense to assign a starting-time interval, rather than a fixed starting time, to each temporal event. During execution, we can then pick starting times from these intervals adaptively, based on any outside disturbances that may occur. We define the `flexibility' we have in executing an event as the length of the interval assigned to the event, and the flexibility of an interval schedule as the sum of the flexibilities of all events. Our goal is to find schedules with maximum flexibility.\n\n\n\nWe want the intervals assigned to events to be independent, so that the starting time we choose from the interval of any one event does not affect the possibilities we have for other events. This requirement is also motivated by another scenario where it makes sense to assign intervals to events, namely when the scheduling problem is distributed across multiple agents. A popular approach to solving the resulting coordination problem is to `temporally decouple' the agents, by adding constraints to the agents' individual problems, such that any schedule they come up with that satisfies their local constraints, can be merged with other agents' schedules to yield a feasible schedule for the overall problem. The problem here is that the added constraints usually decrease the available flexibility.\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the Simple Temporal Network formalism for representing temporal scheduling problems. We show that the problem of assigning intervals to temporal events in an STN, in such a way that the sum of the lengths of the intervals is maximized, can be solved in polynomial time. Any STN S can be transformed into an STN S' in which dependencies between events are resolved. We show that in such an STN S', a maximum flexibility assignment of intervals can be found efficiently, and can serve as the basis for solving the problem in the original STN S.

In addition, in order to accelerate the speed of convergence and reduce the response time for a stable hashing algorithm, we also propose an accelerated method in order to further reduce interactions between users and computer. We evaluate our proposals on two benchmark data sets.

A consequence is that even during off-line planning the choice of decision rules for different stages is tightly interwoven: decisions of earlier stages affect how to act optimally at later stages, and the optimal value function for a stage is known to have a dependence on the decisions made up to that point. This paper makes a contribution to the theory of decentralized POMDPs by showing how this dependence on the `past joint policy\u0089\u00db\u00aa can be replaced by a probability distribution over histories and potentially states.

When there are not enough seed cross-lingual links and inner links, discovering new cross-lingual links becomes a challenging problem. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach that uses concept annotation to boost cross-lingual knowledge linking. Our approach first annotates each wiki article with concepts corresponding to the articles in the same wiki, so that missing inner links can be identified. Then, a pair-wise regression model is trained to predict new cross-lingual links based on six link-based similarity features.  The concept annotation and cross-lingual link prediction are two mutually enforced steps, therefore can be excuted iteratively to incrmentally find new cross-lingual links.

Second, existing research on learning from human-robot interaction has focussed mostly on the motion level (e.g., imitation learning). However, if the goal of teaching is to enable the robot to autonomously solve sequential manipulation tasks in a goal-directed manner, the human should have the possibility to teach the relevant abstractions to describe the task and let the robot eventually levarage powerful relational RL methods. In this paper we formalize human-robot teaching of grounded symbols as an Active Learning problem, where the robot actively generates geometric situations that maximize his information gain about the symbol  to be learned.
